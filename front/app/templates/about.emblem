          h4.section-title our mission
          p.exposition ML Recycling recycles plastic by gathering reclaimed and packaged scrap for export overseas.
          p.expositionIn turn, these plastics are cleaned, processed, and remade into many of the items one may find in their own household, car, or place of business. This process helps to reduce the impact of further resin refinement and production, lowering the carbon footprint on our planet. By reaching out to businesses and individuals currently outside the mainstream recycling industry, we are steadily lowering the rate of reusable materials that would otherwise wind up in landfills as waste.
